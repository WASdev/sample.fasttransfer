## Creating a Liberty Collective

Before running this sample, you will need to create a Liberty collective in which the files will be distributed. First get at least 3 different hosts. Choose one to be the controller and set it up using the instructions [here](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/was_beta_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/tagt_wlp_configure_collective.html?cp=was_beta_liberty%2F1-2-1-0). You will not need to create any members. Next, you will need to register the other hosts to the controller. Follow the instructions [here](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/was_beta_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/tagt_wlp_registerhost.html?cp=was_beta_liberty%2F1-2-1-1). Make sure you register the hosts with writeDir set to where you want your files to go.
