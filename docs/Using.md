## Using the Feature

Make sure your controller server is started and that you have a copy of the truststore on your local machine. Again, this can be found in ${LibertyUserDirectory}/servers/myController/resources/security/trust.jks. Run FTAdmin.jar to get instructions on the arguments you need to input to distribute files.
'''bash
$java -jar FTAdmin.jar
